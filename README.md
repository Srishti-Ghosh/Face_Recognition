# Face Recognition Project using Python and OpenCV

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform real-time face recognition using Python and OpenCV. Face recognition involves detecting human faces in images or video streams and identifying or verifying them against a database of known faces.

### Features:
- Real-time face detection and recognition.
- Integration of a face dataset for training and testing.
- Live video stream processing using a webcam.
- Easy-to-use modular code for extending functionality.

---

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV 4+
- Numpy
- Dlib (for advanced face encodings)

---

## Example Output
After running the face recognition script, the system will:
- Detect faces in the video feed.
- Recognize and label them with the names of known individuals.
- Display real-time frames with bounding boxes and labels.

---

## Customization
1. **Adjust Detection Model**: Use Dlib, or any other supported model in OpenCV for face detection.
2. **Enhance Recognition Accuracy**: Experiment with feature extraction techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or deep learning models.
3. **Integrate with Databases**: Store face data in a database for scalable recognition.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for implementation.
- **OpenCV**: Real-time computer vision library.
- **Dlib**: For advanced face encoding and matching.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
